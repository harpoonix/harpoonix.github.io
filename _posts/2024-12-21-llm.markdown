In collaboration with Amazon, I worked on a project to explore the theoretical underpinnings of the in-context learning capability of LLMs, and to better leverage it for something that can aid fast, natural language based retrieval in databases: the domain of Text-to-SQL models. Our approach combined constrained decoding with question decomposition to answer queries represented by sub-trees of the syntax tree of a complex query. We were able to reduce schema hallucinations and improve coherence of generated SQL through this bottom-up approach.
