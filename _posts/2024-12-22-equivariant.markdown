I am working towards bridging the performance gap in speech recognition for non-native speakers across underrepresented accents and dialects, to create more inclusive models through equivariant learning approaches. We have also been working on efficient wakeword detection (”Hey Alexa!”), where equivariance is desired with respect to shifts within the audio. Our implementation of a shift-equivariant transformer has shown promising results on command recognition, matching state-of-the-art accuracy while displaying significantly less variance with shifts in input.
